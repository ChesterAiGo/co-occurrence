# co-occurrence

In this repository is the implementation of our **co-occurrence** representation method from activation maps. Which was presented in the paper **Co-Occurrence of Deep Convolutional Features for image search**

We define that a co-occurrence happens when the value of two different activations, ai,j,k and au,v,w, are greater than a threshold, t, and both are spatially located inside of a given region. (see Figure 1.).
